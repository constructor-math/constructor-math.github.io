# Math Club Event: AI & Machine Learning

_Is it hot here, or is it just our audience for the AI & ML event?_  
Sorry for the bad joke — but that really made me crack my code.

This event was one of the **largest audiences** we’ve had this year, and that says a lot.  
The term *AI* continues to be thrown mercilessly around by inexperienced “AI gurus” in an attempt to stay relevant.  
This naturally raises the question of what **machine learning and artificial intelligence** truly are —  
which, to the surprise of many, is a purely **mathematical procedure**.

And that, as a **Maths Society event**, is cool!  
Most of us once dreamt of being astronauts, building cool machines, working with technology, or curing diseases.  
But one thing many of us (modulo a few hypermotivated math majors) didn’t dream of doing was... math itself.  

Math has often felt like an additional topic without much symbolic meaning.  
But to truly **comprehend the machinery behind building and innovation**,  
we must understand the math behind every step.  
This is exactly what **Ahmed Maghri** explored in his delightful talk.

Don’t worry — we did the deconfiguration of our minds *after* that equation.  
It turns out that **ChatGPT itself needs math** to process questions and compute answers.  
The large language model uses **probability** to predict the next word —  
kind of like when you’re struck for words yourself.  
(At that point, our wires were exploding in curiousness!)

In a place full of casual students in casual clothes, we had people like **Ahmed**,  
who can never be too dressed for an event — he probably sleeps in a suit!  

This event was our **first official Math Society event**, and it was a success.  
Besides the laughs, we learned to appreciate the **mathematical beauty behind AI**.  
So no, we can’t say, “He tried to impress me, but his humor was *artificial*.”

**Math Support Center (Saturday, 14:00, West Hall 7)!**
