Proof supports the typesetting mathematics using [$\KaTeX$](https://katex.org).
You can use `$ .. $` to write formulas following the $\LaTeX$ math syntax:

```tex
The function $\nu$ is written inline, but can also be in a block:
\\[ \nu: \mathbb{P}^{1} \to \mathbb{P}^{3} \\]
```

The function $\nu$ is written inline, but can also be in a block:
\\[ \nu: \R\PP^{1} \to \PP^{3}. \\]

Multiple math formats work:

- `\\(5\times 5\\)` gives \\(5\times 5.\\)
- `$5\times 5$` gives $5\times 5.$
- `\\[5\times 5.\\]` gives: \\[5\times 5.\\]
- `$$5\times 5$$` (on a separate line) gives

$$5\times 5.$$

**Note:** while `$$ 5\times 5 $$` works, it will enclose the math in a separate block, which is undesirable.

$\KaTeX$ supports a [long list] of fonts and functions, but you can also add
$\LaTeX$ macros in `<script>` tags. For instance:

~~~ html
<script>
macros["\\f"] = "\\mathscr{F}"
</script>
~~~

<script>
macros["\\f"] = "\\mathscr{F}"
</script>

$$ 0\to\Gamma_Y(X,\f')\to\Gamma_Y(X,\f)\to\Gamma_Y(X,\f'')\to 0. $$

$\KaTeX$ even has support for commutative diagrams, though for now only using
the [amscd](https://tug.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/amsmath/amscd.pdf)
syntax, which does not allow diagonal arrows for instance.

<div markdown=0>
\begin{CD}
A       @>{a}>>  B  \\
@V{b}VV      @VV{c}V \\
C       @>{d}>>  D
\end{CD}
</div>

So do numbered equations, in `equation`, `align`, and `gather`.

<div markdown=0>
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}   a &=b+c\\
      &=e+f
\end{split}
\end{equation}
</div>

To use either of these, your input needs to be excluded from Markdown processing like this:

~~~ html
<div markdown=0>
\begin{CD}
...
\end{CD}
</div>
~~~

If you are not familiar with writing mathematics in $\LaTeX$, I highly 
recommend reading and bookmarking this [Wikibooks reference] and using
it to typeset problem sets or exercises to practice. Another great reference
is [this "short" guide] by the AMS. To learn more about $\LaTeX$ itself,
[D.R.Wilkins' Primer] is a decent place to start.
